# Time_evolution_project
Script used to calculate the time evolution of tunneling motions of water clusters

Brief descirption of files:

time_evo_tunham: Script that performs the time evolution of a given Hamiltonian

TD_analysis: analyszes the results of time_evo_tunham, specifically performs FFT and plots results

Time_evo_parse: script for running a batch of calculations through both time_evo_tunham and TD_analysis

Other_files:

input files used for the calculations reported in: Cole and Saykally, J. Chem. Phys., 147 (2017), 014306.
